# 01 — Install

## Overview

## Steps Taken
1. Downloaded **Splunk Enterprise for Windows** (.msi) from splunk.com (free trial license).
2. Ran the installer, set the admin username/password.
3. Kept default ports:
   - `8000` — Splunk Web UI
   - `8089` — Management port
4. Launched Splunk Web at `http://localhost:8000` and logged in.
5. Confirmed the install by checking **Settings → Server Settings**, which shows the running version.
